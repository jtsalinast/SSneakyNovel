Writing rules:
1. Strictly continue from the character states, timeline, and established facts in the story-so-far. Do not contradict them.
2. Stay inside this chapter's outline. Do not borrow material from later chapters.
3. Do NOT preemptively introduce characters, first meetings, identity reveals, or other one-time events that the outline assigns to later chapters — and do not hint at or spoil them.
4. One-time events already played out (first meetings, identity reveals, relationships established) must be treated as established facts and never re-enacted in this chapter.
5. Do not re-summarise the story-so-far. Open straight into this chapter's scene. If a previous-chapter ending is provided, your opening must seamlessly continue its setting, time, and mood without re-establishing what's already there.
6. Each character's dialogue must match their established voice; do not let everyone sound alike.
7. Drive the plot with concrete action, sensory detail, and dialogue. Avoid abstract, summarising narration.
8. Close on a natural cliffhanger or emotional hook. Do not write meta lines like "to be continued".
9. Keep the narrative POV strictly consistent: follow [Narrative POV] throughout; do not switch person or viewpoint subject unless the POV spec explicitly allows alternation.
10. Chapter length must stay within {{.TargetWordsMin}}–{{.TargetWordsMax}} words (target {{.TargetWords}}). Exceeding the upper limit is unacceptable. Cover only this chapter's outline — compress description rather than advancing into later chapters.
11. Output ONLY the chapter prose — no chapter title, chapter number, outline recap, author notes, dividers, or meta lines such as "Chapter X", "(Chapter X text)", "End of chapter", "To be continued", "Here is the revised chapter", "Below is the full text". Do not add any preamble before the prose or any summary after it.`,

[Character beats] Characters that appear and how their relationships move. Explicitly note one-time events such as "A and B meet for the first time" or "B's identity is revealed". If nothing changes, write "no new progress".
[Psychological arc] The protagonist's current mental state, emotional tone, and any pivotal internal turn.
[State changes] What changed about the protagonist (outward: appearance/clothing/behaviour; inward: attitude/perception) compared to the previous chapter. If nothing changed, write "carries over from previous chapter".
[Key details] One or two details with the highest narrative continuation value that later chapters may reference.

Scope (only the following count as problems, nothing else):
1. Character names or honorifics inconsistent with prior text.
2. Timeline contradictions (e.g. previous text ended at night, this chapter inexplicably reverts to morning of the same day).
3. Facts that directly contradict established events (a dead character reappearing without explanation, a destroyed object intact again).
4. Character abilities or identity directly clashing with established setting.
5. Premature introduction of characters, first meetings, identity reveals, or other events that the outline assigns to later chapters.
6. One-time events already played out in prior chapters being re-enacted as new in this chapter.

Notes:
- Style, pacing, scene-length choices, and plot plausibility are subjective issues — always PASS them.
- New information that neither the story-so-far nor the outline mentions is not a contradiction.

1. Each foreshadow should serve the main plot or character arc, not exist for mystery's sake.
2. Each foreshadow has a clear "plant point" (chapter it is seeded) and "payoff point" (chapter where it is expected to be resolved).
3. Foreshadows may interconnect into a web of clues.
4. Vary the types: objects, hinted dialogue, environmental detail, contradictions in behaviour, unexplained phenomena, etc.
5. Spread payoff points across different chapters; do not cluster them.
